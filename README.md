# Reason-ArturiaKeylabEssential-Remote modified for MKII

Remote is [Reason Studio ºs](https://www.reasonstudios.com) protocol for communication between hardware control surfaces and the [Reason](https://www.reasonstudios.com/en/reason) DAW application.

This project provides Reason remote scripts for the **DAW COMMANDS** and **TRANSPORTS** sections of the Arturia Keylab MKII keyboard and the **keyboard** itself (pads, encoders and faders sections).

* Part1/Part2/Live buttons didn't select group variations on map file
  * workaround has been to map L/R arrows to Keyboard Shortcut Variations for now.
